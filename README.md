# Plugins

Repo for my plugins I guess. Basic repo structure and some of the code here was taken from the [KK_plugins](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/tree/master) repository.

## KKPRimController

Adds a window to control KKPRim on the selected characters/objects in studio. It also allows you to load the values of one selected object and transfer them to another.


## ShadowColorSwapper

Swap shadow colors to a configured value at the press of a keybind

## PostProcessingEffects

Massive credit to the original creator [@nHARUKA_KK](https://twitter.com/nHARUKA_KK). I just decompiled their plugin and added features present in the PostProcessingRuntime, but that were not added to the plugin.
